    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Fried rice is a very popular dish across East and Southeast Asia.</p>
    <p>This recipe is my own take on the dish, based on the availability of ingredients in my place.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Carrots</li>
      <li>Zucchini</li>
      <li>Green onion</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Sesame Oil</li>
      <li>Cooked rice</li>
      <li>Egg</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol start="0">
      <li>As a previous step, grab a cup of rice and cook it the day prior.</li>
      <li>Chop some carrots, Zucchinis, green onion, and onion.</li>
      <li>Heat up a wok (or a pan if you don't have a wok) and add some sesame oil.</li>
      <li>When the oil gets hotter, add carrots first, cook for a minute or two and then add zucchini, green onions, and onions. Cook for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Afterwards, add the cooked rice and cook for 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Then, grab an egg, break it and scramble it. Make space in the center of the pan and add a little bit of oil, put the egg in there and cook.</li>
      <li>After a minute or two, add your desired amount of soy sauce to the rice. After a few minutes, turn off the heat and let it cool for a little, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
