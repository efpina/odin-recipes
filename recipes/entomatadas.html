    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This Entomatadas recipe serves as a gentle introduction to Mexican cooking</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the sauce:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>650g - Tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 - Serrano peppers (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 - Onion</li>
      <li>3 - Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>Oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 Cup of water</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Teaspoon - Salt</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>You'll also need:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>20 - Corn tortillas</li>
      <li>1/2 - Onion</li>
      <li>200g - Cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 Cup - Sour cream</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You might also need aluminun foil to help roast the tomatoes and peppers.</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Roast the tomatoes and serrano peppers. It's better if you have a <i>comal</i> around, but if you don't have one you can grab some aluminum foil and roast them with a pan, or even directly into the fire. Set them apart when they're roasted and have a soft consistency.</li>
      <li>At the same time, chop onions into thumb-sized pieces and sauté them alongside the garlic cloves with oil until the onion parts change color. Save the pan for a later step.</li>
      <li>Gather the roasted tomatoes and peppers, and the onion and garlic in a blender alongside oregano and half a cup of water, and start blending until the mix liquifies.</li>
      <li>In the same pan you sautéed the onions and garlic in, add vegetable oil and put the recently blended sauce into it. Add some salt for flavor.</li>
      <li>Cook the sauce with low heat for 10 to 15 minutes until it gets a thicker consistency, stir occasionally.</li>
      <li>In another pan, add some oil so that we can fry tortillas for the dish.</li>
      <li>Fry the desired amount of tortillas (20) in the pan and dry them afterwards.</li>
      <li>When all tortillas are ready, dip them into the sauce, add chopped onions and cheese and roll them over. Repeat for all tortillas.</li>
      <li>After that, add some more sauce, onions and sour cream to complete the dish.</li>
    </ol>
