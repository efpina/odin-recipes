    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Roast the tomatoes and serrano peppers. It's better if you have a <i>comal</i> around, but if you don't have one you can grab some aluminum foil and roast them with a pan, or even directly into the fire.</li>
      <li>At the same time, chop onions into thumb-sized pieces, finely chop garlic and pan fry them with oil until the garlic turns golden brown.</li>
      <li>Put the roasted tomatoes and peppers, and the onion and garlic in a blender alongside oregano and start blending until liquified.</li>
      <li>Heat up a pan (can be the same onions and garlic pan or could be a different one) and add some oil, after gettinng hotter put the recently blended sauce into it.</li>
      <li>Cook the sauce with low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, stir occasionally.</li>
      <li>In another pan, add the oil so that we fry tortillas for the dish.</li>
      <li>Fry the desired amount of tortillas in the pan and dry them afterwards.</li>
      <li>When all the tortillas are ready, dip them into the sauce, add chopped onions and cheese and roll them over. Repeat for all tortillas.</li>
      <li>After that, add some more sauce, onions and (optionally) sour cream to complete the dish.</li>
    </ol>
